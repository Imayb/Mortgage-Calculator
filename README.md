# Mortgage-Calculator
An Android application that calculates a monthly payment and total payment from the users initial amount, interest rate, and how many years they have to pay it off. User can modify data of their amount, downpayment, years, interest rate and the program updates the data. I used this program to also test out onStart, onResume, onRestart, onPause, onStop, onDestory methods and track when we are in the MainActivity and DataActivity with a log message.
